			<h2>Induction Machine Equivalent Circuit Model</h2>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm">
					<p>We have seen that induction machines (as you might guess from the name) operate on
					  the principle of induced currents. There are still two magnetic fields, one from each of the rotor and
					  stator, but the rotor field is induced by the stator field. Effectively, we can think of the induction
					  machine as a rotating transformer. The stator is like the primary of a transformer and creates the
					  initial field, inducing voltages and currents in the secondary rotor winding. The fundamental differences
					  from  a stationary transformer are:</p>
					<ul>
					  <li>The secondary rotates</li>
					  <li>There is an airgap, therefore more mmf is needed for a given flux density</li>
					  <li>The secondary voltage and frequency depend on speed</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The per-phase steady state equivalent circuit model for an induction machine 
					  supplied by a balanced three-phase supply is based on the transformer model shown in Fig. 1. </p>

					<p>We know from the <a href="./im_main.html">operating principles</a> that induced voltage $E_R$
					and rotor leakage reactance \(X_R\) both depend on slip. To simplify the model we can define them both
					in terms of their values when the speed is zero, slip \(s=1\)</p>
					<div class="equation">
						\[
						\begin{aligned}
						E_R &amp; = sE_{R0} \\

					<ul class="symbols">
						<li>$E_{R0}$ is the induced voltage at standstill</li>
						<li>$X_{R0}$ is the rotor leakage reactance at standstill</li>

					<p>With the above definitions we can write the equation for actual rotor current as</p>
					<div class="equation">
						\[
						\begin{aligned}
						I_R &amp; =\frac{E_R}{R_R+jX_R} \\

					<p>In Fig. 2, the effective turns ratio \(a_{eff}\) 
					  is constant and equal to the effective turns ratio at standstill. In a wound rotor machine, 
					  \(a_{eff}\), \(R_R\) and \(X_{R0}\) can be measured. In a cage machine these parameters cannot be directly determined, there is no method to directly measure voltages or currents on the rotor. To overcome this difficulty, the rotor (secondary) circuit
					  can be referred to the stator (primary) side.</p>

				<h3>Full Equivalent Circuit Model</h3>

					<p>Referring the rotor circuit to the primary the induction motor per-phase eqiuvalent circuit, shown in Fig. 3. is obtained.</p>

					to actual rotor values with \(R'_2\), \(X'_2\) used for referred values. In drives texts, it

					and rotor leakage reactance.</p>

				<h2>Power Flow</h2>
				<p>The input power to a three-phase induction machine is given by</p>
				<div class="equation">
					\[
					P_{in}=\sqrt{3}V_{LL}I_{L}\cos\theta=3V_1I_1\cos\theta
					\]
				</div>
				<p>Output power can be found by subtracting the losses from the input power</p>
				<h4>Losses</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Stator Copper Loss. The stator resistive losses
					<div class="equation">
						\[
						P_{SCL}=3I_1^2R_1
						\]
					</div>
					</li>
					<li>Rotor Joule Loss. The rotor resistive losses. This is often called rotor copper loss, but since the
					rotor conductors are aluminum, rotor joule loss is the more correct terminology.
						<div class="equation">
							\[
							P_{RCL}=3I_2^2R_2
							\]
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>Core Loss, or Iron Loss. The losses due to eddy current and hysteresis losses in the laminations. This can be calculated
					using the resistor \(R_c\). At times, to simplify understanding, core losses are grouped with friction and windage and stray loss
					as <span class="emph">rotational</span> losses.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Rotor Power</h3>
				<p>The power transferred to the rotor is called the <span class="emph">&quot;Airgap Power&quot;</span>. Consider the equivalent
				circuit below (the core loss resistance has been removed and core losses grouped into rotational loss).</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="./img/equiv_cct_no_rc.gif"  alt="induction motor equivalent circuit without core loss"/>
					<figcaption>Fig. 4. induction motor equivalent circuit without core loss resistance</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>From the above circuit, the total power transfer to the rotor is given by</p>
				<div class="equation boxed">
					\[
					P_{gap}=\frac{3I_2^2R_2}{s}
					\]
				</div>
				<p>To find the power converted to the mechanical system the rotor joule loss must be subtracted from the
				total rotor power</p>
				<div class="equation">
					\[
					\begin{aligned}
					P_{conv} &amp; = P_{gap}-P_{RCL} \\
					P_{conv} &amp; =\frac{3I_2^2R_2}{s} -3I_2^2R_2
					\end{aligned}
					\]
				</div>
				<div class="equation boxed">
					\[ 
					P_{conv} =3I_2^2R_2 \frac{1-s}{s}
					\]
				</div>

				<p>From the above equations, it can be seen that power converted to the mechanical system is a function of the airgap power and slip:</p>
				<div class="equation">
					\[
					P_{conv}=(1-s)P_{gap}
					\]
				</div>
				<p>Final output power may be obtained by subtracting the rotational loss from \(P_{conv}\).</p>
				<div class="equation">
					\[
					P_{out}  = P_{conv}-P_{rotational}
					\]

				<h2>Induction Machine Torque</h2>
				<h3>Torque Equations</h3>
				<div class="col-sm">
					<p>As with all rotating mechanical systems in steady state, torque can be found from the power and mechanical speed</p>
					<div class="equation">
						\[
						\tau=\frac{P}{\omega}
						\]
					</div>
					<p>In the case of an induction machine the electromagnetic torque generated by the machine, before mechanical (or rotational) losses are deducted, is defined as</p>
					<div class="equation boxed">
						\[
						\tau = \frac{P_{conv}}{\omega_m}
						\]
					</div>
					<p>Using the definitions for power converted in terms of air gap power and mechanical speed as a function of syncrhonous speed:</p>
					<div class="equation">
						\[
						\begin{aligned}
						\tau &amp; = \frac{(1-s)P_{gap}}{(1-s)\omega_s} \\
						\tau &amp; = \frac{P_{gap}}{\omega_s}
						\end{aligned}
						\]
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm">
					<p>Substituting to write the air gap power in terms of the rotor current, the torque can now be written in terms of the rotor current and slip, giving the induction motor torque equation:</p>
					<div class="equation boxed">
						\[
						\tau=\frac{3I_2^2R_2}{s\omega_s}
						\]
					</div>
					<p>The above equation for torque in terms of rotor current and mechanical slip speed is commonly used. Electromagnetic torque developed can also be written in terms of slip frquency as:</p>
					<div class="equation">
						\[
						\tau=3\frac{p}{2}\frac{I_2^2R_2}{\omega_{sl}}
						\]
					</div>					
					<p>Finally, to find the available shaft torque after rotational losses, the output power must be used.</p>
					<div class="equation">
						\[
						\tau_{shaft}=\frac{P_{out}}{\omega_m}
						\]
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="row">


				<h3>Torque Speed Curve</h3>

			<p>Calculating the variation of torque with slip is relatively easy using a spreadsheet or simple script. 
				This plotted is in Fig. 3 over the range of slip from +2 to -1. 
				Remembering that $\omega_m=(1-s)\omega_s$, a slip of +2 corresponds to a speed $\omega_m=-\omega_s$  or $n_m=-n_s$.
				A slip of +1 corresponds to a speed $\omega_m=0$rad/s  or $n_m=0$rpm.
				A slip of -1 corresponds to a speed of $\omega_m=2\omega_s$, $n_m=2n_s$.</p>

				<img src="./img/trq_speed.gif" alt="induction motor torque - speed plot"/>
				<figcaption>Fig. 3. induction motor torque - speed curve</figcaption>
			</figure>
	


			<h4>Operating Regions</h4>
			<p>The torque-speed curve brakes down into three operating regions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Braking, $n_m \lt 0$, $s \gt 1$<br/>
				Torque is positive whilst speed is negative. Considering the power conversion equation
				<div class="equation">
					\[
					P_{conv}=(1-s)P_{gap}
					\]
				</div>
				it can be seen that in this region the power converted is negative, $P_{conv}=\tau \omega_m$. Since $s \gt 1$  
				then the airgap power is positive. i.e. the power is flowing from the stator to the rotor and also into the rotor from
				the mechanical system. This operations is also called <span class="emph">plugging</span>.
				This mode of operation can be used to quickly stop a machine but causes excessive rotor heating. 
				If a motor is travelling forwards it can be stopped by interchanging the connections to two of the three phases. 
				Switching two phases has the result of changing the direction of motion of the stator magnetic field, effectively putting 
				the machine into braking mode in the opposite direction.</li>

				<li>Motoring, $0 \lt n_m \lt n_s $, $ 0 \lt s \lt 1 $ <br/>
				Torque and motion are in the same direction. This is the most common mode of operation.</li>

				<li>Generating,$n_m \gt n_s$, $s \lt 0$ <br/>
				In this mode, again torque is positive whilst speed is negative. However, unlike plugging,
				<div class="equation">
					\[
					P_{conv}=(1-s)P_{gap}
					\]
				</div>
				indicates that if the power converted is negative, so is the air gap power. In this case, power flows from the mechanical 
				system, to the rotor circuit, then across the air gap to the stator circuit and external electrical system.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Motoring Torque Characteristic</h3>	
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm">
					<p>The motoring region of the induction machine torque-speed curve is the region of greatest interest. The
					plots below show a number of different torque speed curves, due to differences in the motor designs. Common features of
					interest are noted and discussed below.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="./img/trq_speed_plots.gif" alt="torque speed plots in the motoring region"/>
						<figcaption>Fig. 4. torque speed plots in the motoring region</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm">
					<div class="equation"></div>
					<ul class="symbols">
					<li>$\tau_{rated}$. The rated torque of the machine. This is the design operating point.</li>
					<li>$\tau_{start}$. The start torque of the machine, when the machine is at standstill.</li>
					<li>$\tau_{max}$, or $\tau_{po}$. 
					The maximum torque or <span class="enph">pull-out</span> torque, which occurs at the slip $s=s_{po}$. Once a machine has 
					reached rated operating point, 
					this is the maximum torque that can be applied without stalling the machine (pulling out). 
					In reality, since this torque is significantly more than the design rated torque, continuous operation at maximum torque is not
					possible due to thermal heating issues. (Currents will be above rated values, $I^2R$ losses will be excessive.)</li>
					<li>$\tau_{pu}$. The pull-up torque of the machine. In some machines, the lowest point on the torque speed
					curve between starting and pullout is not the start torque. In this case it is important to know the pull-up torque. This is the 
					minimum torque that the motor can accelerate up to the desired operating speed.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>In steady state operation, an induction motor will operate at the speed where the mechanical load torque equals the 
					torque developed by the motor. At low speeds, the difference between the motor torque and the load torque accelerates the machine.
					Normal operation is to the right of the maximum torque $\left(s\lt s_{po}\right)$. In this region, an increase in the load torque 
					will cause the motor to slow, increasing the motor torque until an equilibrium is reached. To the left of the pullout torque, no 
					such equilibrium can be reached. Mechanically,</p>
					<div class="equation">
						\[
						\tau_{motor}-\tau_{load}=J\frac{d\omega_m}{dt}
						\]
					</div>
					<p>where $J$ is the rotational inertia of the mechanical system.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<h3>Pull-out Torque</h3>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm">
					<p>Analysing the full equivalent circuit it was observed that</p>
					<div class="equation">
						\[
						\tau = \frac{P_{gap}}{\omega_s}
						\]
					</div>
					<p>Therefore, since synchonous speed is constant, maximum torque occurs at the
						same slip as maximum airgap power. It is possible to develop a set of equations for a Thevnin equivalent of the stator and 
						magnetizing branch impedances and solve for maximum power transfer to the rotor. This circuit analysis approach is not considered 
						in this course. However, this analysis demonstrates that the maximum torque acheived by an induction motor is independent of rotor
						resistance, while the slip for maximum torque is proportional to rotor resistance. This result enables designers and motor 
						manufacturers to build induction machines with different torque speed curve characteristics. </p>
